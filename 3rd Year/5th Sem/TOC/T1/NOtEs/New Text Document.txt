1. Distributed Web Scraper / Crawler with Scrapy & Redis
Real-World Problem: Scraping large websites (e.g., e-commerce catalogs, news archives) is slow and prone to being blocked. A naive script can't handle millions of pages efficiently or respectfully.

What to Build from Scratch:
Build a scalable, distributed, and polite crawling system.

Core Crawler: Use Scrapy to build spiders. Implement custom middleware for:

Rate Limiting: Automatically adhering to robots.txt and adding delays between requests.

User-Agent Rotation: Using a pool of user agents to avoid fingerprinting.

Retry Logic: Handling failed requests with exponential backoff.

Distributed Architecture: This is the key. Use Redis as a central message broker.

Multiple scraper "worker" processes running on different machines (or containers) pull URLs from a shared Redis queue.

Deduplication is handled in Redis to ensure the same URL isn't scraped twice (Bloom Filter is ideal here).

Scraped items are pushed to another Redis queue for processing.

Data Pipeline: Another set of workers consumes the scraped data, validates it, cleans it, and stores it in a persistent database (e.g., PostgreSQL or S3).

Monitoring: Implement a basic dashboard (with Flask/Socket.IO or Grafana) to monitor the number of URLs in the queue, requests per minute, and errors.

Tech Stack: Python, Scrapy, Redis, Docker (to containerize workers), PostgreSQL, Celery (optional, for the pipeline).

Why it's Professional: This mirrors the architecture of real-world scraping platforms like Apache Nutch. It demonstrates understanding of distributed systems, queues, concurrency, and resilience.
